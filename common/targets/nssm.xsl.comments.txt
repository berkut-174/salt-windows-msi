This regards ISSUE 1     https://github.com/markuskramerIgitt/salt-windows-msi/issues/1


Heat collects files into XML file salt-windows-msi\wix\MinionMSI\dist-amd64.wxs
Some file are excluded

This line is especially sad:

            <Component Id="cmpF3CE08C037F32A1C76DF93B02A6ACB79" Directory="dirA7CC33A34163812EEAF3B20CD074A564" Guid="{357ECA3A-24C0-49C5-9964-6CF9504168C4}">
                <File Id="filF7B75C18646D054B4C42FBFF0826EBA7" KeyPath="yes" Source="$(var.dist)\conf\minion" />
            </Component>
			
It means that Wix treats conf/minion as part of the installation.
On uninstall, WiX removed all parts of the installation.

Approach 1:
  Remove the GUID of the component.
  No idea how to do that.
  
  
Approach 2:
  exclude the components.
  nssm.xsl should be doing exactly that.
  It filters out nssm.exe
  in fact nssm.exe is not in salt-windows-msi\wix\MinionMSI\dist-amd64.wxs
  This is an error.
  There is no nssm.exe, also if I remove the filter.
