       I am looking for error e: https://github.com/markuskramerIgitt/salt-windows-msi/issues/8
	   Is TARGETDIR maybe e: ?
	   Yes!
	   Line 172 of the install log:
	       PROPERTY CHANGE: Adding TARGETDIR property. Its value is E
	   Why is TARGETDIR set to e: ?
	   Looking further up.
	   Line 147 of the install log:
	       PROPERTY CHANGE: Adding ROOTDRIVE property. Its value is E
	   I dont want that!
	   I have configured a drive e: for testing recovery. Maybe this confuses WiX
	   From     http://badecho.com/2008/12/the-root-of-the-problem/
		  If you don’t define and set ROOTDRIVE in the property table of your installer database,
		  then the tool installing the product has to set the property.
		  How does it determine which drive to assign to ROOTDRIVE?
		  It simply looks at all available hard drives, and chooses the one with the most free space.
		This says MSDN     https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa371372(v=vs.85).aspx

	   Solution: (from badecho)
	     Setting ROOTDRIVE to SystemDrive
